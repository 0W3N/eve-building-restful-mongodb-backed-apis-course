00:01 In this chapter we saw how we can leverage the builtin flexible validation rules
00:05 to properly design our endpoint schemas
00:08 and make sure that documents coming into our service
00:11 are conforming to the expectations.
00:14 If necessary, we now also know how to extend a system
00:18 to build custom validation rules and types.
00:21 This is the right moment to mention that the Eve validation system
00:25 is actually provided by a separate package called Cerberus.
00:29 Cerberus is another open source project of mine
00:33 which you can use as a validation work course in your own projects, if you wish.
00:38 Cerberus and Eve websites have plenty of details,
00:42 usage examples and more importantly,
00:45 the complete list of available rules,
00:47 which to be honest, there are more besides the one we've seen in this chapter.
00:53 I suggest you go and take a look at them because well,
00:56 data validation is such a vital part of any rest service
00:59 that you really want to gain full control over it.
