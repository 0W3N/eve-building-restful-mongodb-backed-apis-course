00:01 It's time to meet your instructor.
00:03 I am Nicola, hey, nice to meet you!
00:05 I'm excited that you are taking my class.
00:07 I live in Ravena, Italy, where I run a software company
00:10 that makes accounting apps for small businesses.
00:13 I am a Microsoft MVP, a MongoDB Master,
00:17 a speaker at local and international conferences and a teacher.
00:21 In my spare time, I also run the local CoderDojo, a coding club for kids,
00:27 and DevRomagna, the leading developer community in my area.
00:30 What is probably more relevant to you however,
00:33 is that I am the author and maintener several
00:36 Python and C# open source projects
00:38 one of them being the Eve Rest framework.
00:41 I have been leading the Eve project and its ecosystem for five years now
00:46 so as you can imagine, I am quite involved with it
00:48 and I am looking forward to share my knowledge with you.
00:52 If you want to learn more about me and my activity,
