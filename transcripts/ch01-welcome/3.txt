00:01 Of course, I am going to show you a lot of code.
00:03 I strongly suggest that you build your own little experimental repo
00:07 and then try to carefully reproduce and improve on my examples,
00:10 but do know that everything you see me type
00:13 is also available on github for you to fork, star or download and play with.
00:18 You will find all the course material at
00:20 talkpython/eve-building-restful-mongodb-backend-apis-course.
00:25 So please got here and make sure you star or fork it right away.
