00:01 We are going to write some code in this course
00:03 so we need some kind of code editor, right?
00:05 Well, when it comes to coding,
00:08 a Python developer is left with a number of options.
00:10 Now, I won't get into the text editor versus IDE debate, not today, at least.
00:17 Personally, I happen to work on different platforms and languages
00:20 so depending on the task at hand, you can find me doing Python on Vim
00:23 or C# in Visual Studio when I am on Windows.
00:26 So yes, I'm using minimal text editors as well as IDEs,
00:30 Vim is so wound up in my muscle memory
00:32 that even when I am on Visual Studio I still use Vim key bindings.
00:36 Lately, I also had been doing both C# and Python,
00:40 and Javascript to be honest, on Visual Studio code.
00:44 For this course, I am going to use Code.
00:46 It is a fantastic, open source editor widely adopted by the Python community.
00:51 It runs on MacOS, on Windows and on Linux.
00:55 It is free, very stable and also actively maintained.
01:00 I find it to be the perfect compromise
01:02 between a pure text editor like Vim,
01:04 and a full blown IDE like Visual Studio or PyCharm.
01:08 Of course, you're free to use your preferred editor or IDE,
01:11 but if you want to follow me as I type my code,
01:14 you may want to download and install Code.
01:17 You never know, you might end up liking it a lot.
01:19 Getting Code is simple, you just have to go to code.visualstudio.com
01:24 and hit this big download button here
01:28 where you can pick your preferred version.
01:31 As I mentioned already, you can get it on the Mac, on Windows or on Linux,
01:35 just make sure that on Linux, you get the correct version,
01:39 depending on your distribution.
01:41 You can also click on this button here in the upper right corner
01:44 you will get basically the same links and options.
01:47 Once Code is on the system
01:49 we want to get it ready for Python.
01:52 So let's activate the virtual environment that we created
01:56 when we installed Eve in a previous lecture.
01:59 Source, and here we are,
02:08 as you can see, our virtual environment is active now
02:11 let's pip freeze so we know which packages are installed,
02:18 yes, Eve is there, ready to go.
02:21 Now, we need a folder where we want to work and write our Python scripts,
02:25 so let's create it,
02:30 and then let's move into it, right,
02:36 now, we can launch our editor
02:39 we'll use a dot to instruct Code that we want to work
02:43 on this very folder where we are sitting right now.
02:49 And here we go, as you can see, Code is ready for us,
02:53 and it is already on our folder, as we can see here.
02:57 Before we can start coding in Python,
03:00 we need to install the proper installation.
03:02 So let's go over here, to the extension tab and click on it.
03:06 As you can see, we get a nice list of available extensions, for Code.
03:09 Yes, there are a lot of them, actually,
03:13 they are probably are in the order of the hundreds, if not thousands,
03:17 you name a language, a stack or a framework
03:19 you probably will find two, three, five extensions for it.
03:23 It is really a huge number and what's even more interesting is
03:27 that they are sorted by number of installs,
03:30 and as you can see, the top one is Python,
03:32 let's click on it.
03:34 On the right pane, we get a lot of information about the extension,
03:37 quick start, link to the documentation etc,
03:40 but, look at the download number here,
03:43 at the time of this recording, we are at almost 6 million downloads,
03:47 it's a huge number I believe and it tells a lot about the adoption rate
03:52 of Code by the Python community.
03:55 And next, look at the release,
03:59 this is actually a Microsoft release, so it is an official extension
04:02 and there is a little story here
04:05 because actually the guy who started working on this project
04:07 started it as a community project on github,
04:10 then, as the adoption kept growing
04:13 Microsoft reached out to this guy and they ended up hiring him,
04:16 so now he is a Microsoft employee
04:19 and the extension itself is an official extension by Microsoft.
04:23 Now, this is interesting for a few reasons,
04:25 but I find it is important because it tells a lot
04:28 about the commitment of Microsoft into open source, Python and Code.
04:33 So let's install the extension, click on this start button here,
04:37 it will take a while, and done.
04:40 Once the extension is installed, you need to reload it, and here we go,
04:45 Python is now installed and we are ready to go.
