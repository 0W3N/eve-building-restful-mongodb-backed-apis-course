00:01 Before we dwell on Eve itself, we really need to talk about Flask.
00:05 Why, you ask?
00:07 Firstly, because Eve is built on top of Flask, keep that in mind
00:11 because it is very important and powerful.
00:13 Anything you can do with Flask, you can also do with Eve,
00:17 that is remarkable, because by leveraging Flask and Eve,
00:21 you end up being able to fine tune, extend and customize
00:24 basically every single feature that comes with the framework itself.
00:28 So in this section, we will make ourselves comfortable with Flask
00:32 and trust me, it will be worth it.
00:35 Once we move on to Eve in the next sections
00:38 you will be amazed at how comfortable you feel sitting at the Eve wheel.
00:42 Now if you look at the Flask about page
00:45 you see that Flask tags itself as a micro web development framework,
00:49 what does it really mean?
00:51 Micro doesn't mean that the web app
00:53 has to fit into a single Python file of course,
00:55 nor does it mean that Flask is lacking in functionality.
00:59 The micro in micro framework actually means
01:02 that Flask aims to keep the course simple, but extensible.
01:05 Flask want to make many decisions for you
01:09 such as what database to use,
01:11 those decisions that it does make however, are easy to change.
01:14 Everything else is up to you
01:16 so that Flask can be everything you need and nothing you don't.
01:19 Again, being micro doesn't mean lack of functionality,
01:23 let's look at its acclaimed Restful request dispatching for example;
01:28 here we are looking at two possible roads for our apo,
01:31 one, obviously being the home page
01:33 and the other one being a Hello URL.
01:36 As you can see, we are using a decorator to instruct Flask
01:39 on which functions should be run when a user hits a certain URL or endpoint.
01:44 How nice is that?
01:46 There is more to it, of course,
01:48 like the option to add variable parts to you URL to use.
01:51 But you can already see how Eve could easily
01:55 leverage and build on top of this feature
01:58 to provide an out of the box, yet powerful and easy to use routing mechanism.
02:03 Flask also comes with a built in development server and debug support.
02:09 This is super important when you are prototyping
02:12 and then writing web apps.
02:14 You get all sorts of debugging formations,
02:17 like stack traces and variable inspection
02:20 just by setting an environment variable as we see here.
02:23 In the following line, we see how easy it is to launch the application itself.
02:28 This is possible, because Flask comes with its own development server
02:32 which is more than good enough to play and test the app
02:36 before going into production.
02:39 There are many other nice things that are coming with Flask
02:41 and one of my favorites has got to be the integrated support for unit testing.
02:46 When you're building a framework
02:48 you want to make sure that it is well tested.
02:50 That is true for any kind of web app really,
02:52 but if your end users are going to be developers,
02:55 well, you want to make your test as complete and effective as possible.
03:00 Flask native support for unit testing
03:02 which we can see at work in this course snippet, is a key feature,
03:06 and we have of course been abusing it while developing the Eve framework.
03:10 If you're going to write your own web apps or frameworks with Flask,
03:13 you really want to get to know everything about testing Flask
03:16 and of course, its debug mode and development server.
03:20 So Flask is cool and it is fun.
03:22 It is easy to set up and use, but being micro by desine
03:27 doesn't come with the tons of a high level features
03:30 such as database access or an admin backend.
03:34 Luckily and precisely because it is micro, powerful and easy to extend
03:39 over time a huge number of Flask extensions have surfaced
03:43 and are now available for you to use.
03:45 The extensions' registry is loaded with all kind of useful tools
03:49 which you can plug into your app and most of the times Eve too,
03:53 and then be on your way,
03:55 or you can build your own extension
03:57 and then contribute it to the community.
04:00 In fact, one of the reasons why Flask is so popular
04:02 is because it is very easy to build on top of it,
04:05 and in any case, the extension registry is at your fingertips
04:10 where you don't feel like reinventing the wheel.
