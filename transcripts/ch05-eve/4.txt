00:00 And what about sorting? Of course you can sort too,
00:03 you just have to use the sort keyword in your query definition,
00:06 so for example, here we are sorting by location.city and then by last name,
00:13 and because I am using a dash before the last name,
00:17 field I want then reversed.
00:21 So basically I am looking for all the people with no filter,
00:25 because I am not using the sorted by location.city
00:29 and last name reversed.
00:32 Let's see what happens, we have 7 documents,
00:35 the first document here has no location subdocument as you can see
00:40 the second is the same, no location,
00:43 the third one is in Ashfield
00:50 and then we have another person living in Auburne,
00:56 and then New York comes, and then San Francisco,
01:00 San Francisco again and if we check it on the last names,
01:03 we will see that they are sorted by diverse order.
01:06 For example, we have 2 people living in San Francisco
01:10 let's go and see, we have miss Julia Red first
01:14 and then comes Miss Serena Love,
01:18 so yes, we are getting them in reverse order,
01:21 of course, we can also mix a filter with sorting,
01:24 so here we might go with something like where—
01:31
01:38 okay, so here we are looking for all the people living in San Francisco
01:43 sorted by last name reversed.
01:46
01:49 Only 2 documents, and we can see they both live in San Francisco
01:56 and the first one has last name Red
02:01 and then Love, again, if I remove the dash here
02:05 I am sorting by last name
02:08 and we should get the same two documents
02:10 but the first one is Love this time and the second is Red.
02:15
02:17 Also, when using sort you might want to switch to a Mongo syntax
02:22 something like this, which isn't probably very intuitive,
02:29 but you can do that if you want to,
02:33
02:39 same result, of course.
