00:01 Speaking about queries, let's see
00:03 how we could perform queries against our remote API.
00:06 Let's say that we want to find all the people where last name is Green.
00:12 So we go over here to the URL and we set a query string
00:17 we use the where keyword
00:20 and then we go with a Mongo syntax,
00:23 you can see here it is basically a Json object
00:27 so find all the documents where last name is Green.
00:31 Let's try this one, and as you can see,
00:35 we only have one document back
00:37 and it is exactly what we were looking for,
00:40 let's try something more complex
00:42 and find all the documents where last name is Green
00:45 and also location.city is Ravena, which is my hometown in Italy.
00:55
00:59 Zero documents back, and that makes sense,
01:04 it is what we expected, as you can see, the items array is empty.
01:07 Now if we go back to my query and replace Ravena with New York
01:12 I should get back my Green guy again.
01:18 Because location city is in fact New York,
01:22 so as you can see, you can also query on subdocuments,
01:25 like we did here using the . syntax
01:28 you can chain multiple conditions
01:30 and you can basically use
01:32 all of the MongoDB supported operators like or, and, etc.
01:38 You have also another option,
01:40 if you don't like the Mongo syntax,
01:42 maybe you are not familiar with it,
01:44 you can actually use the Python syntax, which is different,
01:50 let's try one example where last name=green
01:57 same result, as you can see.
02:04 So different syntax, similar result.
02:09 Now we will see in the following segments
02:12 that you can actually configure your API
02:16 and decide which syntax you want to support,
02:19 by default, both of them are allowed,
02:21 but you can actually turn Python syntax off
02:25 or Mongo syntax on and off, however you please.
