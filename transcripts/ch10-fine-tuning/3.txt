00:00 As we saw endpoint pagination is enabled by default
00:03 in order to improve performance and preserve bandwidth.
00:07 When a client requests data, the first items matching the query are server
00:11 and links to the next and previous pages are included with the response.
00:16 Default page size as well as
00:18 maximum number of allowed items per page is configurable,
00:22 but first let's see how we can disable pagination altogether.
00:27 Well, this is very simple we have as you now can imagine
00:31 a boolean setting which is true by default, pagination
00:36 we can simply turn it off like this,
00:40 pagination is a delicate feature because it can have a huge impact
00:44 on your server performance
00:46 so if you don't need it for some reason, you can simply turn it off
00:51 and clients won't be able to slow down your service at all,
00:55 and because pagination is so important you can also set it at a local level
01:01 for example here, I might want to have pagination
01:08 still enabled at the people endpoint
01:11 while I keep it disabled at the global level
01:15 so all the other endpoints will have pagination disabled
01:18 except for the people endpoint
01:21 and whatever else endpoint I decide it should have it.
01:25 Even if it is less likely to happen, you might want to change
01:29 the word used in your queries to ask for a specific page,
01:33.09 like we did with where and sort,
01:35 you can simply set query page to whatever value you want.
01:42 Likewise, we might want to change the word used
01:49 to define a maximum number of items the clients would receive per page.
01:55 The default is max results, but you can change it whatever you want.
02:06 Now speaking of max results, it has a default value,
02:08 if you go back to Postman and try to send a request for a single page here
02:14 we get the items and we see that the max result is 25.
02:19 We can change this value to whatever we please
02:21
02:26 here we're setting the max result default value to 50 documents per page.
02:31 You can also set a limit on these max result number
02:36 pagination limited the setting you need for that
02:43 and the default value is 50
02:46 so you probably want to stay between 50 and 100 maybe
02:50 but that might be already a bit too much, honestly.
02:54 Pagination default again is 25
02:57 so you want to stay around these values for your service
03:00 unless you have a very good hardware
03:03 and you are not very worried about pagination performance;
03:06 or you are optimizing for pagination speed
03:10 because there is an optional optimized pagination for speed option
03:16 it is disabled by default but you can switch it on
03:19 it can greatly improve performance on large collections
03:23 but it comes with a few consequences.
03:26 Firstly, no document count is returned with a response.
03:29 Secondly, pagination links are less accurate as no last page link is available.
03:35 while next page link is always included, even on the last page.
03:39 Again, on big collections switching this feature on can greatly improve performance.
03:45.61 It defaults to false for slower performance
03:48 but document count is included, and the accurate link pages are provided.
