00:0.2 Hypermedia as the engine of application state
00:03 or as it is known— HATEOAS
00:7.24 is enabled by default on the framework.
00:11 So each get response includes a links section,
00:14 links provide details on their relation
00:18 relative to the resource being accessed and a title.
00:21 Relations and titles can then be used by clients
00:26 to dynamically update their UI
00:28.65 or to navigate the API without knowing its structure beforehand.
00:34 Hyper media as the engine of application state is a nice feature
00:37 it is included in the Rest principles and by default,
00:41.58 the Eve framework supports it,
00:43 but to be honest, I've not seen so many clients make use of this feature
00:48 and also many Rest services are not providing it.
00:52 So you have the option to turn it off if you want to
00:55 let's go and first look at the typical output you get from a get request.
01:01 Let's close the items array and here it is our links section,
01:06 we don't want these, let's see how we turn it off.
01:11.5 By now you probably already imagine what's going to happen.
01:16.53 I've just set HATEOAS to false. Save, relaunch.
01:26 And send a request again
01:28 we're still getting the items array, the meta tag is still there
01:33.47 but there's no links section
01:36 so we have disabled the feature completely,
01:40 let's go to a single document endpoint,
01:43 no links section here neither.
01:47.99 Now, if we want the feature on
01:50 but we want to change the key used in the Json for this feature,
01:56.17 we can do that very easily
01:58 we just need go back, enable the feature
02:2.01 then set links equal to whatever value we want to use as the key for the feature.
02:08 So here we're using links, but without the underscore
02:11
02:14 let's restart the server, and see what happens
02:18 bam, feature is back on but this time
02:20 we have customized the key used for the feature.
02:24 We can also check the people endpoint,
02:28 links is there without the underscore and the feature is back.
02:33.17 It is worth noting that when you disable the feature,
02:37.02 you're also losing the pagination feature because as you know,
02:41.16 pagination links are included within the links section.
02:44.67 This is probably worth considering
02:46 you get a nice performance boost because you aren't doing any pagination.
02:51 You don't have any links section,
02:53.55 but you are also losing some valuable information for your clients.
02:58.95 Finally, keep in mind that you can also
03:03 switch the feature on and off at a local level,
03:05 so here we have the feature on globally,
03:8.57 but we can go to the people endpoint for example,
03:11 and set it to off, if we don't want it at this endpoint.
