00:00 Projections are a powerful feature,
00:03 they allow a client to dictate of all document fields
00:05 which ones should be returned with the response.
00:08
00:11 In this request here we're asking for just the last name field
00:15 let's send it over and we can see that all the documents still have
00:21.05 the meta fields because these are always included
00:24 no matter the projection. We can also exclude fields,
00:27 for example, here I'm excluding the last name field
00:30 I want all the fields but not last name
00:33 and as you can see, here we're getting first name, location,
00:36 age, role, etc, but no last name.
00:40 Projections are nice because they allow the client
00:44 to pick only the fields it really needs.
00:47.72 Imagine if the people document had a picture
00:50 if we don't need a picture, we can just exclude it
00:55 and we won't be forced to download it, how nice is that?
00:59.06 You can, of course, disable projections
01:02 you simply go to the code editor in your settings file
01:05 and set projection to false.
01:10 This is global, and as you might expect by now
01:13 you can go and switch it on at local level if you want to.
01:18
01:24.02 So now projections are disabled at all endpoints but people.
01:28
01:29 Of course, we can also change the word used to query for a projection
01:36
01:41 let me save, relaunch, go back to Postman,
01:49 and use fields instead. Got it.
01:56 Now, so far we've have seen that the client can control projections
02:00 but we can actually predefine projections on server side.
02:05 Let's see how we do that.
02:10 Let's first clean up a little bit,
02:13
02:15 all right, we define server side projections at the endpoint level,
02:20 let me paste an example here,
02:23 data source is dictionary and it allows the projection key
02:29 do not confuse this projection key with root level projection boolean
02:33 which allows you to turn projection feature on and off.
02:38 So here we're setting a projection server side
02:41 every request sent to the people endpoint
02:44 will not include last name by default
02:47 let's try this, save, relaunch as usual and let's ask for people
02:58.82 without any client projection, same response.
03:03 No last name included with the response
03:06
03:16 as you can see, clients can still alter the output if they wish
03:19 but that the default is a different projection
03:23 it is a server projection,
03:26 default server side projection can come in handy in several situations
03:29 one is the picture we mentioned before,
03:32 you aren't letting the clients download it by default
03:36 but they can still go and require it with a specific projection should they need it.
03:41 Also keep in mind that projections are a read-only thing
03:46.19 they don't apply to write operation.
03:48 You still have a schema endpoint and clients can still write
03:53 the world document or edit the world document as they please.
